# SwissBorg Web Challenge

This is a _homework project_ demonstrating the capabilities of [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/).

The application is communicating with an external API that is located under the predefined address. See `next.config.js` for more details.

## Development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
